# Variables and Types in Rust

Rust's approach to variables and types creates the foundation for its safety guarantees.

## Key Concepts

- **Variable binding**: How values are assigned to names
- **Type inference**: How Rust determines types automatically
- **Mutability**: Controlling whether variables can change
- **Shadowing**: Creating new variables with the same name

## Variable Binding

In Rust, we use the `let` keyword to bind values to names:

```rust
let name = "Ferris";
let age = 3;
```

## Type Annotations

While Rust can infer types, we can be explicit with type annotations:

```rust
let name: &str = "Ferris";
let age: u32 = 3;
```
