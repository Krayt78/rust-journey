# Rust Fundamentals

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of the Rust programming language, providing a solid foundation for your Rust journey.

## Corresponding Chapters in the Rust Book

This section covers material from the following chapters in the official Rust Book:
- [Chapter 1: Getting Started](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html)
- [Chapter 2: Programming a Guessing Game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
- [Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html)

## Key Topics

This chapter covers:
- **Hello World**: Your first Rust program
- **Variables**: Declaring and using variables in Rust
- **Data Types**: Understanding Rust's type system
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions
- **Control Flow**: Conditional statements and loops

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into subdirectories, each covering a specific fundamental concept:

1. **01_hello_world**: Getting started with your first Rust program
2. **02_variables**: Understanding variables and mutability
3. **03_data_types**: Exploring Rust's various data types
4. **04_functions**: Defining and using functions
5. **05_control_flow**: Using if/else statements and loops

## Learning Through Challenges

Each topic includes:

1. **Teaching Section**: The top part of each file contains working examples that demonstrate concepts with explanations in comments.

2. **Challenges Module**: A module at the bottom of each file with intentionally broken code that you need to fix. These challenges test your understanding of the concepts presented in the teaching section.

To complete the challenges:
1. Read through the teaching section to understand the concepts
2. Look at the broken code in the challenges module
3. Fix each issue to make the code compile and run correctly
4. The code contains validations that will tell you if your fixes are correct

## What's Next?

After completing this chapter, you'll be ready to dive into Rust's core concepts like ownership, borrowing, and data structures in the next chapter.
