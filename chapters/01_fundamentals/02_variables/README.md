# Variables and Mutability in Rust

Variables are a fundamental concept in any programming language. In Rust, variables have some unique characteristics that help ensure memory safety and prevent common bugs.

## Corresponding Section in the Rust Book

This section corresponds to [Chapter 3.1: Variables and Mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html) in the official Rust Book.

## Key Concepts

- **Immutability**: Variables are immutable by default
- **Mutability**: Using the `mut`
