# Functions in Rust

Functions are the primary way we organize code in Rust. They allow us to group code, make it reusable, and give names to blocks of functionality.

## Corresponding Section in the Rust Book

This section corresponds to [Chapter 3.3: Functions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html) in the official Rust Book.

## Key Concepts

- **Function definition**: Creating functions with the `fn` keyword
- **Parameters**: Passing values into functions
- **Return values**: Getting values back from functions
- **Statements vs. expressions**: Understanding the difference in function bodies
- **Scope**: How variables work within functions

## Learning Path

1. Start with [`basic_functions.rs`](./basic_functions.rs) to learn how to define and call functions
2. Move on to [`function_parameters.rs`](./function_parameters.rs) to understand how to pass data to functions
3. Continue with [`return_values.rs`](./return_values.rs) to learn how functions can return data
4. Explore [`function_expressions.rs`](./function_expressions.rs) to understand expressions in function bodies
5. Complete [`advanced_functions.rs`](./advanced_functions.rs) to learn about more complex function concepts

## Why Functions Matter

Functions allow you to:
- Organize code into logical, reusable units
- Avoid code duplication
- Isolate functionality to make testing and debugging easier
- Create abstractions that hide implementation details

## Learning Through Challenges

Each file in this section follows the same pattern:

1. **Teaching Section**: Examples with detailed explanations in comments
2. **Challenges Module**: Code with intentional errors for you to fix
3. **Tests**: Validation code to verify your solutions

Fix each issue to make the code compile and run correctly. The tests will tell you if your fixes work.

Happy coding! Remember that making mistakes and fixing them is one of the best ways to learn.
