# Functions in Rust

Functions are the primary way we organize code in Rust. They allow us to group code, make it reusable, and give names to blocks of functionality.

## Corresponding Section in the Rust Book

This section corresponds to [Chapter 3.3: Functions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html) in the official Rust Book.

## Key Concepts

- **Function definition**: Creating functions with the `fn` keyword
- **Parameters**: Passing values into functions
- **Return values**: Getting values back from functions
- **Statements vs. expressions**: Understanding the difference in function bodies
- **Scope**: How variables work within functions

## Learning Path

This section is organized into progressive folders, each exploring a different aspect of functions in Rust:

1. Start with [`0_basic_functions`](./0_basic_functions/) to learn how to define and call functions
2. Move on to [`1_function_parameters`](./1_function_parameters/) to understand how to pass data to functions
3. Continue with [`2_return_values`](./2_return_values/) to learn how functions can return data
4. Explore [`3_function_expressions`](./3_function_expressions/) to understand expressions in function bodies

## Why Functions Matter

Functions allow you to:
- Organize code into logical, reusable units
- Avoid code duplication
- Isolate functionality to make testing and debugging easier
- Create abstractions that hide implementation details

## Learning Structure

Each subfolder in this section follows the same pattern:

1. **README.md**: An overview of the specific function concept with instructions
2. **challenge.rs**: Code examples with intentional errors for you to fix
3. **learnings.md**: Detailed explanations of the concepts with clear examples

To get the most out of each topic:
1. Read the README.md file first to understand the concept
2. Study the detailed explanations in learnings.md
3. Work through the challenges in challenge.rs
4. Experiment by making your own modifications to reinforce learning

Happy coding! Remember that making mistakes and fixing them is one of the best ways to learn.
