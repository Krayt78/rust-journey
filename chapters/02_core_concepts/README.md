# Core Concepts in Rust

This chapter builds on the fundamentals and introduces essential core concepts that make Rust unique and powerful. These concepts form the foundation of Rust's safety and performance guarantees.

## Key Topics

- **Ownership**: Rust's approach to memory management without garbage collection
- **Borrowing**: How to reference data without taking ownership
- **Structs**: Creating custom data types to organize related values
- **Enums**: Defining types with multiple possible variants
- **Pattern Matching**: Powerful control flow based on Rust's type system
- **Modules**: Organizing code and managing scope and privacy

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into subdirectories, each covering a specific core concept:

1. **01_ownership**: Understanding Rust's ownership system
2. **02_borrowing**: References and borrowing rules
3. **03_structs**: Creating and using structured data types
4. **04_enums**: Working with enumerations and variants
5. **05_pattern_matching**: Advanced pattern matching techniques
6. **06_modules**: Organization, scope, and visibility

## Learning Through Challenges

Each topic includes:

1. **Teaching Section**: The top part of each file contains working examples that demonstrate concepts with explanations in comments.

2. **Challenges Module**: A module at the bottom of each file with intentionally broken code that you need to fix. These challenges test your understanding of the concepts presented in the teaching section.

To complete the challenges:
1. Read through the teaching section to understand the concepts
2. Look at the broken code in the challenges module
3. Fix each issue to make the code compile and run correctly
4. The code contains validations that will tell you if your fixes are correct

## What Makes Rust Special

Rust's core concepts serve a clear purpose: to provide memory safety without garbage collection and thread safety without significant runtime overhead. These concepts might feel restrictive at first, but they enforce practices that lead to more reliable and efficient code.

Once you master these core concepts, you'll have a solid foundation for writing any Rust program, from command-line utilities to high-performance web services.

## What's Next?

After completing this chapter, you'll be ready to explore more advanced Rust features like traits, generics, and error handling in later chapters.
