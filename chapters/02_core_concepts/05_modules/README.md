# Managing Growing Projects: Modular Code Organization in Rust

As your Rust projects grow in size and complexity, organizing your code becomes increasingly important. This section covers Rust's module system, which provides powerful tools for structuring code into manageable, reusable components.

## Corresponding Section in the Rust Book

This section corresponds to [Chapter 7: Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html) in the official Rust Book.

## Section Overview

This section is divided into the following subsections, each focusing on a specific aspect of Rust's module system:

1. [**Packages**](./01_packages/README.md) - Understanding the highest level of code organization in Rust
2. [**Crates**](./02_crates/README.md) - Working with compilation units that produce libraries or executables
3. [**Modules Basics**](./03_modules_basics/README.md) - Learning the fundamental building blocks of code organization
4. [**Paths**](./04_paths/README.md) - Navigating the module tree to find items
5. [**Privacy and Visibility**](./05_privacy_and_visibility/README.md) - Controlling which items can be used by outside code
6. [**The use Keyword**](./06_use_keyword/README.md) - Bringing paths into scope and creating shortcuts

Each subsection includes explanations, examples, and exercises to help you master that specific aspect of the module system.

## Learning Path

We recommend working through these subsections in order, as each builds upon the concepts introduced in the previous ones. By the end of this section, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to organize Rust code effectively.

## What You'll Learn

- How to structure your code for better organization and readability
- How to control the visibility of your code to enforce encapsulation
- How to create and use modules, packages, and crates
- How to use the module system to create clear APIs
- Best practices for organizing growing Rust projects

## What's Next?

After completing this section, you'll be ready to move on to more advanced topics such as error handling, generic types, and traits, which build upon your understanding of Rust's module system.
