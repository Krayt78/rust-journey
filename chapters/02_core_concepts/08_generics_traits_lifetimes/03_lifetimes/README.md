# Lifetimes

Lifetimes are Rust's way of ensuring that references remain valid for as long as they're needed. They're a unique feature of Rust that helps prevent dangling references and memory safety issues without requiring a garbage collector.

## In This Section

This folder contains examples and exercises for working with lifetimes in Rust:

- Understanding the basics of lifetimes and scopes
- Using explicit lifetime annotations in functions
- Implementing structs that contain references
- Learning about lifetime elision rules
- Working with the 'static lifetime
- Combining lifetimes with generics and trait bounds

## Practice

Open the Rust file in this directory to explore the examples and complete the exercises:
- [2_lifetimes.rs](./2_lifetimes.rs) - Examples and exercises for lifetimes

## Key Points

- Lifetimes are part of Rust's type system and are checked at compile time
- Most of the time, lifetimes are inferred by the compiler through elision rules
- Explicit lifetime annotations are needed when the compiler can't determine the relationships between references
- Lifetimes ensure that references remain valid for their entire intended use

## Next Steps

After understanding lifetimes, proceed to the final folder to see examples that combine generic types, traits, and lifetimes into practical, reusable code patterns.
