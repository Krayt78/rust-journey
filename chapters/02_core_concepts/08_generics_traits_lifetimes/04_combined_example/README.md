# Combined Examples: Generics, Traits, and Lifetimes

This section demonstrates how to combine generics, traits, and lifetimes to create powerful, flexible, and safe Rust code. These patterns are commonly used in real-world Rust libraries and applications.

## In This Section

This folder contains comprehensive examples that integrate all three concepts:

- A generic container with type-specific implementations
- Data processors that use references and lifetimes
- A repository pattern using generic types and traits
- An API client that combines all three concepts for type-safe API interactions

## Practice

Open the Rust file in this directory to explore the examples and try the challenge:
- [3_combined_example.rs](./3_combined_example.rs) - Complex examples and a coding challenge

## Key Points

- The combination of generics, traits, and lifetimes allows for extremely flexible and reusable code
- These techniques enable you to write abstractions that are both type-safe and performance-efficient
- Real-world Rust libraries often use all three features together to create robust APIs

## Next Steps

After understanding how to combine generics, traits, and lifetimes, you're ready to explore more advanced Rust features or start applying these concepts in your own projects.

Consider exploring:
- Functional programming features (closures and iterators)
- Smart pointers
- Concurrency in Rust
- Advanced patterns with macros
