# Traits

Traits define shared behavior that different types can implement. They are similar to interfaces in other programming languages but with more powerful features like default implementations and trait bounds.

## In This Section

This folder contains examples and exercises for working with traits in Rust:

- Defining and implementing traits
- Using default method implementations
- Specifying traits as parameters in functions
- Applying trait bounds with generics
- Returning types that implement traits
- Using where clauses for complex trait bounds
- Working with trait objects for dynamic dispatch
- Utilizing associated types in traits

## Practice

Open the Rust file in this directory to explore the examples and complete the exercises:
- [1_traits.rs](./1_traits.rs) - Examples and exercises for traits

## Key Points

- Traits enable polymorphism while maintaining Rust's performance and safety guarantees
- Default implementations reduce code duplication
- Trait objects allow for dynamic dispatch at runtime
- Associated types provide more flexible APIs compared to generic parameters in some cases

## Next Steps

After understanding traits, proceed to the next folder to learn about lifetimes, which are another essential part of Rust's type system that ensures memory safety.
