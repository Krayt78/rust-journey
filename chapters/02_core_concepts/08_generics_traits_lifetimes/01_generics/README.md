# Generic Types

Generic types allow you to write code that works with multiple types. This powerful feature enables you to create flexible and reusable functions, structs, enums, and methods without sacrificing type safety.

## In This Section

This folder contains examples and exercises for working with generic types in Rust:

- Creating generic functions
- Implementing generic structs with one or multiple type parameters
- Defining methods on generic types
- Using generic enums like `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>`
- Applying type constraints with trait bounds
- Understanding how generics are compiled (monomorphization)

## Practice

Open the Rust file in this directory to explore the examples and complete the exercises:
- [0_generics.rs](./0_generics.rs) - Examples and exercises for generic types

## Key Points

- Generic types in Rust have zero runtime cost due to monomorphization
- Use type constraints to ensure your generics only work with types that support the operations you need
- Start with concrete types and generalize only when needed for better code reuse

## Next Steps

After understanding generic types, proceed to the next folder to learn about traits, which are often used in conjunction with generics to define shared behavior.
