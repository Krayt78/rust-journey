# Collections in Rust

Collections are data structures that can store multiple values. Unlike arrays and tuples, which have a fixed size known at compile time, collections store data on the heap, allowing them to grow or shrink during runtime.

## Corresponding Section in the Rust Book

This section corresponds to [Chapter 8: Common Collections](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-00-common-collections.html) in the official Rust Book.

## Overview

Rust's standard library includes several powerful collection types that provide different trade-offs in terms of performance, memory usage, and functionality. This chapter covers the most commonly used collections:

1. [**Vectors**](./01_vectors/README.md) - Resizable arrays that store elements of the same type
2. [**Strings**](./02_strings/README.md) - UTF-8 encoded text stored as a collection of bytes
3. [**Hash Maps**](./03_hash_maps/README.md) - Key-value stores that allow efficient lookups

## Why Collections Matter

Collections are essential tools in a programmer's toolkit for many reasons:

- They provide flexible storage that can adapt to runtime needs
- They offer optimized implementations for common data management tasks
- They standardize operations like searching, sorting, and filtering
- They encapsulate memory management details, making code safer and clearer

## Performance Considerations

Different collections have different performance characteristics:

| Collection | Advantages                                   | Potential Drawbacks                        |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Vector     | Fast access by index, efficient append       | Slow insertion/removal in the middle      |
| String     | Optimized for text operations, UTF-8 encoded | Complex character handling                |
| HashMap    | Fast lookups by key                          | No defined order, higher memory overhead  |

## Learning Path

When working through this section, we recommend focusing on:

1. Understanding when to use each collection type
2. Learning the common operations for each collection
3. Recognizing the performance implications of different operations
4. Practicing with real-world scenarios that demonstrate collection usage

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- Choose the appropriate collection for different scenarios
- Perform common operations on vectors, strings, and hash maps
- Understand how Rust's ownership rules apply to collections
- Use iterators to process collection data efficiently
- Implement common algorithms using Rust's collection types

## Next Steps

After learning about collections, you'll have a solid foundation for building more complex data structures and algorithms in Rust. This knowledge will be essential as you move on to topics like error handling, generics, and advanced traits.
