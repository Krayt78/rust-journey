# Test Organization in Rust

As your project grows, organizing your tests becomes increasingly important. Well-structured tests make your codebase more maintainable and help ensure comprehensive test coverage.

## Corresponding Section in the Rust Book

This section corresponds to [Chapter 11.3: Test Organization](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html) in the official Rust Book.

## Principles of Test Organization

When organizing tests in Rust, keep these principles in mind:

1. **Group related tests together**: Tests that verify similar functionality should be placed together.
2. **Name tests clearly**: Test names should describe what they test and the expected outcome.
3. **Follow a consistent pattern**: Use a consistent structure for all your tests.
4. **Separate test utilities**: Place common test setup code in a separate module or function.
5. **Keep tests independent**: Tests should not depend on the outcome of other tests.

## Organizing Unit Tests

Unit tests can be organized into multiple test modules:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    // Tests for feature A
    mod feature_a_tests {
        use super::*;
        
        #[test]
        fn test_feature_a_success() {
            // ...
        }
        
        #[test]
        fn test_feature_a_failure() {
            // ...
        }
    }
    
    // Tests for feature B
    mod feature_b_tests {
        use super::*;
        
        #[test]
        fn test_feature_b_basic() {
            // ...
        }
        
        #[test]
        fn test_feature_b_edge_cases() {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

## Test Fixtures and Setup/Teardown

Often, tests need common setup and cleanup code. In Rust, you can use functions or even special types to handle this:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    // Test fixture function
    fn setup() -> Database {
        let db = Database::new_in_memory();
        db.create_table("users").unwrap();
        db
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_insert_user() {
        let mut db = setup();
        db.insert("users", "alice", "data").unwrap();
        assert_eq!(db.count("users"), 1);
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_find_user() {
        let mut db = setup();
        db.insert("users", "alice", "data").unwrap();
        assert_eq!(db.find("users", "alice").unwrap(), "data");
    }
}
```

## RAII Pattern for Resource Cleanup

For resources that need cleanup (like files or network connections), you can use Rust's RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern:

```rust
struct TestFile {
    path: std::path::PathBuf,
}

impl TestFile {
    fn new() -> Self {
        let path = std::path::PathBuf::from("test_file.txt");
        std::fs::write(&path, "test data").unwrap();
        TestFile { path }
    }
}

impl Drop for TestFile {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        std::fs::remove_file(&self.path).unwrap();
    }
}

#[test]
fn test_with_file() {
    let file = TestFile::new();
    // The file exists during the test
    assert!(file.path.exists());
    // The file is automatically deleted when `file` goes out of scope
}
```

## Organizing Integration Tests

For integration tests, organize them by feature or module:

```
my_project/
├── src/
│   └── ...
└── tests/
    ├── user_management.rs   // Tests for user management features
    ├── authentication.rs    // Tests for authentication features
    ├── data_processing.rs   // Tests for data processing features
    └── common/              // Shared test utilities
        └── mod.rs
```

## Running Specific Tests

Rust allows you to run specific tests or groups of tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with names containing a string
cargo test user

# Run tests in a specific module
cargo test user_management

# Run a specific test
cargo test test_user_creation
```

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test Driven Development is a development methodology where you:

1. Write a failing test that defines a desired feature
2. Implement the simplest code to make the test pass
3. Refactor the code while keeping the tests passing

Following this cycle helps ensure your code is testable and meets requirements from the start.

## Best Practices for Test Organization

1. **Use descriptive test names**: Name tests according to what they test and the expected outcome.
2. **Follow a consistent pattern**: Use patterns like `test_[function]_[scenario]_[expected]`.
3. **Test one thing per test**: Each test should verify one specific aspect of behavior.
4. **Keep tests small and focused**: Large tests are harder to debug when they fail.
5. **Don't test private implementation details**: Focus on testing the public API.
6. **Avoid test interdependence**: Tests should not depend on the order they run in.

## Key Points

- Well-organized tests improve maintainability and test coverage
- Group related tests into modules
- Use test fixtures for common setup code
- Apply the RAII pattern for resource cleanup
- Make tests independent of each other
- Follow a consistent naming pattern for tests

## Conclusion

Effective test organization is crucial for maintaining a reliable and maintainable codebase. By applying the principles and techniques covered in this section, you'll be able to build robust test suites that grow with your project.
