# Rust Journey

A comprehensive hands-on approach to mastering Rust through guided chapters, collaborative workshops, and real-world projects.

## Philosophy

Rather than isolated exercises, Rust Journey provides a cohesive learning path that builds competency through:

1. **Chapter Learning**: Progressive knowledge building with guided examples
2. **Workshops**: Collaborative problem-solving scenarios
3. **Projects**: End-to-end applications that apply multiple concepts

## How to Use This Repository

### 1. Chapter Learning

Each chapter focuses on specific Rust concepts with:
- **Content**: Explanatory markdown with code snippets
- **Examples**: Working code demonstrating concepts
- **Challenges**: Problems to solve with guidance
- **Self-check**: Questions to validate understanding

Start with Chapter 1 and progress sequentially, completing the challenges as you go.

### 2. Workshops

Workshops are guided collaborative sessions where you:
- Implement specific functionality
- Learn to work with external crates
- Practice solving real-world problems
- Build components that could be used in larger projects

### 3. Projects

Projects are complete applications that:
- Combine multiple Rust concepts
- Provide a scaffold with clear TODOs
- Include automated tests
- Result in a functional end product

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
3. Begin with Chapter 1 in the chapters directory
4. Complete the challenges within each chapter
5. Move to workshops once you've completed relevant chapters
6. Build projects as the capstone to your learning

## Tracking Progress

Use the `tools/progress.rs` script to track your journey:
